### Task Management System
The Task Management System is a web-based application designed to facilitate the organization and tracking of tasks for individuals or teams. The system provides a user-friendly interface for creating, updating, and managing tasks, streamlining the workflow and enhancing productivity.

## Description
The Task Management System is built with a frontend developed using Angular and a backend implemented with Java (Spring Boot). The system leverages a relational database (e.g., MySQL) for persistent storage of task-related information. Users can interact with the application through an intuitive and responsive web interface.

## Features
1. #  Task CRUD Operations
Create: Users can easily create new tasks by providing essential details such as task name, description, and due date.

Read: The system allows users to view a list of existing tasks along with their details, including completion status.

Update: Users can modify task details, enabling them to adapt to changing requirements or provide additional information.

Delete: Unnecessary or completed tasks can be removed from the system, decluttering the task list.

2. # Database Integration
Relational Database: The application integrates with a relational database (e.g., MySQL) to store and retrieve task information efficiently.

Table Design: The database schema includes well-defined tables and relationships to organize task-related data systematically.

3. # Security
Authentication: Basic authentication mechanisms are implemented to ensure secure access to the API endpoints.

Authorization: Endpoints are protected from unauthorized access, ensuring that only authenticated users can perform certain operations.

4. # User-Friendly Frontend
Clean Interface: The frontend is designed with a clean and intuitive user interface, providing a seamless experience for users.

Task Display: Users can easily view, add, update, and delete tasks directly from the frontend.

5. # Error Handling and Validation
Input Validation: The system validates input data to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the information provided by users.

Error Handling: Graceful error handling is implemented to provide informative messages and enhance the user experience.

6. # Documentation
Codebase Documentation: The codebase includes clear and concise documentation to facilitate understanding and future development.

Setup Instructions: Instructions for setting up and running the application are provided in the README file for ease of deployment.

7. # Responsive Design
Responsive UI: The frontend is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across various devices.
The Task Management System aims to improve task organization, enhance collaboration, and boost productivity for individuals and teams. Whether managing personal tasks or coordinating team projects, the system provides a reliable and efficient solution.
